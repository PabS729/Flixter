### Notes
I found a problem about not including identifiers for the property section of moviecell, which caused an exception to be thrown and the app to crash when opening the collection view. Fortunately I got help from the instructors of the course and I am very grateful to receive such immediate help. Great thanks to Tim Lee and Mihai Ruber for their excellent solutions!

### Notes
I am using the school's Mac for writing this app, so I can't write the files (e.g. cocoapods) into my app's base directory. 
I tried several other ways to load the movie poster images but none have worked.
The issue will be fixed after I get my macbook and start working on part 2.
